# Guidelines for flaschard and note creation and management

In the Obsidian.md vault, there is a system for creating and managing flashcards. The system consists of these parts:

- "Notes" - these are notes in the "Notes/Magisterske" directory. They cover topics from software engineering. These notes consist of flashcards that are written directly in the notes. One note covers one exam quesion (which can consist of many topics).
- "Flashcards" - have a format specified below

## Example note template

File location: "Notes/Magisterske/NI-SI-1 NI-ADP.md"

```markdown
---
created: 2024-05-26T10:17:27
parent: "[[FIT]]"
---

TARGET DECK: NI-SZZ
FILE TAGS: NI-SI-1 NI-ADP

> NI-SI-1 (NI-ADP)
> Informační bezpečnost, architektura bezpečnosti v modelu OSI. (BI-BEZ)
```

Description:

- Note Name - always consists of `<note id>` and `<subject id>`
- TARGET DECK - is always `NI-SZZ`
- FILE TAGS - consist of `<note id>` and `<subject id>`
- In the note there is then a short description consisting of `<note id>` and `<subject id>` and on the next line the exact description of the exam question

## Example flashcard format

Flashcards are created directly in the note. Here is the example format:

```markdown
START
NI-SZZ

Co je **Informační technologie (IT)**?

Back:

technologie na zpracování informací

Tags: should-know N001F001

<!-- Documentation comments - dont put the comments in the note -->
<!-- first tag must always be the priority of how important the flashcard is to know. The options are: must-know | should-know | could-know | fun-to-know. Always put should-know as the default option. -->
<!-- second tag represents the order of the flashcards and notes. N001 stands for note index, F001 for flashcard index inside that note. -->

<!-- Flashcards that already have been synchronized to Anki will have the following comment here. Never remove or change that ID comment! -->
<!--ID: some number -->

END

### Flashcard conventions

- In the question and answer sections, always highlight the most important phrase or word with a bold text, so that it is easier to read quickly.
- In the flashcard, it is possible that there will be image references (`![[image_name]]`) - always keep those images in the flashcards
- In the flashcard, it is also possible that there will be some special comments (e.g. `DetailInfoStart`, `ExampleStart` etc.). These comment sections represent a detailed explanation of the answer. Never remove those!
- When copying flashcards from some source, DON'T CHANGE the content of the flashcard! Always copy the whole flashcard.
- In the note, you can split the flashcards using `###` markdown headers based on the parts of the exam questions so that it is easier to read
